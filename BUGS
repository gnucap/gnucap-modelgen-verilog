== modelgen
- all variables are static, some speed impact.
- $limit: only "pnjlimit"
- ac needs operating point, even if linear: mg2_cccs.0.gc
- ddx, flow(<port>): no derivatives (feature?)
- filter contribution to potential, uses internal node.
- V<+ddt(I) does not work on same branch (related?)
- string type is missing (breaks "%s" in strobe etc.).
- types don't work. 1/2 equals .5
- cleanup hack breaks detach_all
- `default_transision missing, and some step control

== simulator plugins
- "ground" statement not implemented.
- still missing tiebreak rules in overload
- paramset: requires newlines, v_paramset.2a.gc

== libgnucap, TODO
- need NODE_P, discrete nodes
- MODEL_CARD in lang interface
- BUG: padding long lines with whitespace
- tab/newline handling in cmd.warn Exception_CS
- branch node order is suboptimal

== fixed, presumably. recheck.
- analysis("ic"): need more testing
- c_pulse.so: obsolete hack, need discontinuities.
- V<+laplace(...) sign bug
- event control is incomplete
- llvm build: sometimes crashes during shutown
