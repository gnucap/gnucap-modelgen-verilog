== Simulation components used in modelgen models

Used during modelgen subcircuit expansion.

Generally, these are parameterised using COMPONENT::set_parameters.
Stand-alone operation is intended but incomplete.

- absdelay (stub)
- d_va_flow: flow source
- potential
- switch
- ddt/idt
- slew
- laplace_*
- z_*
- white_noise
- flicker_noise

== Simulator extensions

Overlay plugins, staged for upstream inclusion.
Currently bundled with components above, for convenience.

- lang_verilog: modified version, to be symchronised
- c_param: parameters with ranges
- v_paramset: interpreted paramset
- v_instance: paramset resolution
- v_module: modified from d_subckt
