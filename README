== preliminary gnucap modelgen

For now, compute and test partial derivatives.

Build with "make", requires gnucap >= 20230304.

test: see tests/README

== build system notes

There is a configure script, but it does not yet work as intended.

== preprocessor notes

- gnucap-verilog { -I path -D def .. } --pp: preprocesses a file.
- `include "quoted" works simlar to quoted C #include.
- -I sets include path.
- -D defines a symbol. Assign a value with -D"VARIABLE value"..
- Files are located following logic from gcc implementation.
- Output is sent to standard out, like cpp.
