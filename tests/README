== gnucap modelgen tests

Run with "make check". Optionally a TESTSELECT may be specified to subselect
tests

$ make check TESTSELECT=dump # will only test "dump*"

Desired output is stored in ref, actual output will be in check/*.out
See check/${TESTSELECT}.diffs for results (no diff == good).

== Code coverage testing

Test coverage is computed following this protocol, see [1] for more
background.

- Places "untested calls" at each test hook.
  There is an "untest" target in the top level Makefile.

- Compile the program with CPPFLAGS=-DTRACE_UNTESTED.

- Edit out the "untested" calls that are reached by the tests.

More automation is currently under test. The intent is to retest after every
change before committing.
