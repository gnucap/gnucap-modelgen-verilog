== gnucap modelgen tests

Run with "make check". Optionally a TESTSELECT may be specified to subselect
tests

$ make check TESTSELECT=dump # will only test "dump*"

Desired output is stored in ref, actual output will be in check/*.out
See check/${TESTSELECT}.diffs for results (no diff == good).

== run old test script (untested)

$ ./test ../gnucap-verilog '' check ref
