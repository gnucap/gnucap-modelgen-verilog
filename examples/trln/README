== "spice" rc chain

An rc chain models a transmission line.
Compute ac characteristic and a transient.

$ gnucap rc_chain.gc
[..]

Find the data in
rc_chain_*.out

== recursive definition

Verilog-AMS allows recursive circuit definitions by means of paramset
overloading. Here, a similar rc chain is constructed from a shorter one.

$ gnucap rc_recursive.gc
[..]

The data is stored in
rc_recursive_*.out

see also ../tests/v_trln.0.gc for recursive RLGC

== generate

WIP

== transmission line

work in progress on RLGC line. need transient. see also ../tests/v_trln.0.gc.
