== "spice" rc chain

An rc chain models a transmission line.
Compute ac characteristic and a transient.

$ gnucap rc_chain.gc
[..]

Find the data in
rc_chain_*.out

== recursive definition

Verilog-AMS allows recursive circuit definitions by means of paramset
overloading. Here, a similar rc chain is constructed from a shorter one.

$ gnucap rc_recursive.gc
[..]

The data is stored in
rc_recursive_*.out

see also ../tests/v_trln.0.gc for recursive RLGC

== generate

WIP

== transmission line

Gnucap has a built-in transmission line, implemented as a delay line. Here's a
(partial) Verilog-AMS implementation and comparison.

$ gnucap-mg-vams --cc tline0.vams | g++ -xc++ `gnucap-conf --cppflags` -fPIC -shared - -o tline0.so
$ gnucap trln_absdelay.gc
[..]

== frequency domain modelling

Verilog-AMS opens a new perspective to data driven transmission line (TL)
modelling. Typically, measurement (VNA) or EM simulation (Maxwell) results are
in terms of scattering parameters, and well known methods extract transfer
functions from them.

See trln0.vams for a TL modelled in terms of transfer functions (no meaningful
coefficients) and trln_laplace.gc for a simulation.

$ gnucap-mg-vams --cc trln0.vams | g++ -xc++ `gnucap-conf --cppflags` -fPIC -shared - -o trln0.so
$ gnucap trln_laplace.gc
[..]

== RLGC

work in progress on RLGC line. need transient. see also ../tests/v_trln.0.gc.
